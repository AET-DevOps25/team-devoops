# Deployment
The `deployment` directory contains necessary files for the deployment of Meet@Mensa application. 

To deploy the system manually on your local machine, follow the guides below. Automated deployment workflows in GitHub Actions can be found under `../.github/workflows`.

## Docker Compose
Use the following commands to start / stop / inspect the project using Docker Compose:
```
cd docker                       # Move to docker directory
docker compose up --build       # Starts project in the foreground (with force re-build)
docker compose up -d            # Starts project in the background
docker compose ps               # Shows all running containers
docker compose down             # Stops the project
docker compose logs             # Shows the logs of all containers
docker compose pull             # Pulls the images of all services
docker images                   # Shows locally chached images
```

## Kubernetes Helm
Prerequisites: 
- you are already authenticated in a running Kubernetes cluster (see Kubeconfig file),
- the microservice images are built and pushed to GHCR (see `README.md` in individual microservices),
- database access passwords already exist as secrets in the `devoops` namespace:
```
kubectl create secret generic <match/user>-db-secret \
  --from-literal=MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='<your-password>' \
  --namespace devoops
```

Once the three requirements are fulfilled, you can run the application:
```
helm install meetatmensa ./k8s -n devoops   # Installs the Helm chart and deploys it to devoops namespace
kubectl get all -n devoops                  # Shows all Kubernetes resources deployed in devoops namespace
helm uninstall meetatmensa -n devoops       # Deletes all resources deployed with the Helm chart
```
If you want to access cluster-internal services, you can utilize port-forwarding: `kubectl port-forward svc/meetatmensa-<service> <port>:80 -n devoops`. Do not use ports 8080, 8081 or 8082 - they are reserved as entry points to the application (client service).

## AWS Deployment

For AWS deployment, use the `compose.aws.yml` file which is configured for production deployment with SSL certificates and monitoring.

### Access Points
- **Client Application**: https://client.54.204.29.206.sslip.io
- **API Gateway**: https://api.54.204.29.206.sslip.io



## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

Meet@Mensa includes a comprehensive monitoring stack with Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and Loki for log aggregation.

### Local Deployment (Docker Compose)

When running locally with Docker Compose, monitoring services are available at:

- **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
  - Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`
  - Access dashboards for application metrics, logs, and system health

- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
  - View metrics, alerts, and targets
  - Access alert rules and their current state
