## ⚒ - Task Distribution & Tool Choice (2025-05-12)
- Our group distributed 3 UML diagrams (deliverables of Week 2) between the 3 members and agreed on using the [Apollon](https://apollon.ase.in.tum.de/) tool for diagram creation.
- It was agreed that the diagrams should be submitted for peer review via a PR by Wednesday EOD. On Thursday & Friday morning, we will review each other's diagrams, suggest and implement improvements.
- We scheduled a short meeting on 2025-05-14 to discuss the initial backlog items as well as the unresolved questions from Week 1: search filtering, user group sizes and the final tool name.

## 🚀 - Product Backlog (2025-05-13)
- Our tutor created and invited us to our team's GitHub Project, where @Anastasiia created the first 3 issues for this week's iteration in the format of Scrum stories.
