## ‚öí - Task Distribution & Tool Choice (2025-05-12)
- Our group distributed 3 UML diagrams (deliverables of Week 2) between the 3 members and agreed on using the [Apollon](https://apollon.ase.in.tum.de/) tool for diagram creation.
- It was agreed that the diagrams should be submitted for peer review via a PR by Wednesday EOD. On Thursday & Friday morning, we will review each other's diagrams, suggest and implement improvements.
- We scheduled a short meeting on 2025-05-14 to discuss the initial backlog items as well as the unresolved questions from Week 1: search filtering, user group sizes and the final tool name.

## üöÄ - Product Backlog (2025-05-13)
- Our tutor created and invited us to our team's GitHub Project, where @Anastasiia created the first 4 issues for this and last week's iterations in the format of Scrum stories.

## üó®Ô∏è - Meeting 1.2 (2025-05-14)

We met for a half hour on Thursday to discuss the questions listed in last week's devlog.

### Filtering
We agreed that it is better to produce a match that finds a table for every participant, rather than one that perfectly matches a few participants, but leaves others without a table.

To achieve this, we decided to include soft filtering, which attempts to match students with other students that match the their filtered preferences first, but will still produce a match even if these criteria cannot be fullfilled.

We also decided to assign the highest priority to making sure that every student gets a match, even if that means other students may not have their filter criteria fullfilled.

### Group Sizes
We settled on group sizes of ideally 3-4 students per match. Further details will be discussed more extensively when we are actually working on developing our matching system.

### Tool Name
Several new names were suggested:
- Mensa Meet
- Mensa Match
- Mensa Mates
- Meet and Mensa
- MunchMate
- Fourked
- SitWithUs
- Meet@Mensa

A quick round of voting resulted in **Mensa Mates** and **Meet@Mensa** being the most popular.

We selected **Meet@Mensa** as the name for our project!
